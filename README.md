# ☁️ Secure Data Sharing in Cloud Computing with Multi-owner Access

Cloud Computing has revolutionized how organizations store and access data by offering computing and storage resources as services over the internet. However, enabling **secure and efficient data sharing** among **multiple users and owners** remains a significant challenge.

This project explores mechanisms to ensure secure, organized, and reliable data sharing in cloud environments—especially when **multiple users** simultaneously access, modify, or share organizational data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Enable **secure data sharing** across multiple users and groups in the cloud.
- Address challenges arising from **simultaneous data access** and **multi-owner environments**.
- Explore models that go beyond traditional file access and support **service-oriented architecture**.

---

## 📌 Problem Overview

Unlike traditional systems, cloud-based storage:
- Allows **shared access** by multiple stakeholders (owners and end-users).
- Faces risks of **unauthorized access**, **data inconsistency**, and **access control breaches** when data is modified by more than one owner simultaneously.
- Requires new mechanisms for **secure sharing**, **group access**, and **conflict resolution**.

---

## 🧠 Proposed Approach

This project explores:
- **Group-based access control models** for managing permissions efficiently.
- **Multi-owner conflict resolution mechanisms** to ensure data integrity.
- Techniques for **secure data synchronization** when concurrent edits or updates happen.
- Usage of cryptographic techniques such as:
  - Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE)
  - Proxy Re-encryption
  - Group Key Management (GKM)

---

## 🔐 Key Features

- ✅ Secure sharing of organizational data among multiple users.
- ✅ Access control models for owner–group–user hierarchies.
- ✅ Efficient handling of concurrent updates.
- ✅ Cloud compatibility with service-oriented architectures (SOA).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Java
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS 
- **Security Libraries**:  Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot (for API-level integration)
